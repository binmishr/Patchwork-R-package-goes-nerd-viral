A Brief Introduction
======================

Patchwork package is easy it was to mix and match multiple R plots into one image, I gave it a quick share with some basic highlighting of how to use the package. I knew it was a cool package but I had no idea how excited people would get! For a relatively niche subject on twitter, this tweet got a lot of traction. The tweet interaction was not just with R users! It also had a lot of python users calling for the same functionality with matplotlib.

By the time the hype was over, it reached 6.9K likes and 1.8K retweets. While this volume might not be traditionally viewed as viral on twitter, I would certainly say that this tweet has gone “nerd viral”. It was definitely shocking to me.

To pay homage to the tweet and the package, I’ve decided to conduct a little analysis on the tweet performance and possible impact on package downloads. I’m going to get so meta with this analysis, that I’ll then arrange the resulting plots with patchwork.
